# (CPU-ASMS) CPU-ASymmetric-Meta-Simulator
 A Meta CPU Simulator Engine to allow simulation of Custom CPU Architectures and Low Level Algorithms

 **Note: This project was originally created in github repository** [ https://github.com/Medic5700/Book-of-Algorithms/blob/master/CPUsimulator.py ] [2023-05-25]
 It has been moved here for continued development (**minus commit history**).

### Development Stack
- Python 3.10 or greater (required for variable annotations support)
- A terminal that supports ANSI (IE: default Ubuntu Terminal or the "Windows Terminal" app for Windows)
