    '''Random Design Notes:

    Issues/#TODO:
        Instruction functions should give warnings when input/output bitLengths aren't compatible. IE: multiplying 2 8-bit numbers together should be stored in a 16-bit register
        configSetInstructionSet() should autofill stats datastructer for any unfilled in data. (but should also show a warning)
        ProgramCounter should be semi-indipendant from instruction functions (unless explicidly modified by instruction functions)(IE: not an automatic += 1 after every instruction executed)
            This would allow for representation of variable length instructions in 'memory'
            program counter should be already incrimented before instruction is executed, so instruction doesn't have to change the program counter unless needed (like a jump)
        create instruction helper that takes in a number and creates a 'imm' value
        Note: Use Big Endian, it's convention in most cases
            If an array pointer points to a specific byte in a four byte word, does it point to the big side or little side (Big Endian points to the big side)
        Load upper immediate needs to be a thing
            Some instructions can't store a large immediate value, and use 'load upper immediate' to load the upper bytes of a large immediate
            since immediate registers are generated on the fly, and 'load upper immediate' is called before a specific a instruction...
                There needs to be a way to specify that a just declared immediate should be bolted onto the next declared immediate
            How does this impact out of order execution?
            possible implimentation:
                could have imm registers always have the last index be a blank index, and some operation is done to it whenever the next immediate is added?
                A special temp immediate register that is only used for loading upper immediates
                Immediate registers could be generated in pairs, allowing different instructions to interact with multiple pairs of immediates
                    IE: 'load upper immediate' creates 'imm1[1]' and 'imm2[1]' puts a number in 'imm1[1]', 'add immediate' creates 'imm1[2]' and 'imm2[2]', puts a number in 'imm2[2]' and combines it with 'imm1[1]'
                    Immediate registers are reset between instructions, so this wouldn't be visible to the next instruction
                could create an 'upperImm' register as part of custom ISA, and a special 'combine with immediate' function in the custom ISA (like enforceImmediate()) (which also resets the 'upperImm' register)
                    Would get around the persistance problem
                    Would be kind of 'hacky' as it could require extra control flags, etc
        Data to keep track of:
            stats:
                number of times a line is executed
                energy use per line
                cycles used for execution
        ? Instruction functions on execution should return a dictionary of info on function stats (IE: energy used, latency, instruction unit used, etc?)
            Makes instruction set composition easier (since lambda functions don't also need to copy a bunch of function properties)
            Makes instruction manipulation harder (IE: you can't know how long an instruction will take to execute ahead of time, or which execution unit it will use, or how to profile it)
        Parser:
            split line rule needs to be able to recurse, and take different characters to split with
            needs a rule to label containers as function arguments, array indices, other?
            Parser currently assumes all source code to process is perfect with no errors/typos, and thus is super fragile
            Parser 'rules' need more functionality for each function, to make it more modular
        Instructions/Special considerations
            System Calls
                How to handle system calls?
            Load and Store instructions should be able to handle bit-addressing within a memory element
            Should I define a function that enforces only a specific memory access?
                Like enforceImm(imm), enforcing access only to the imm registers. But for different registers, like 'r', or 'm'
            https://youtu.be/QKdiZSfwg-g?t=5728
                The 'repeat' prefix instruction in x86
                'repeat' (1 byte) prefix, 'moveString' (1 byte) instruction, with registers EDI (extended implicid source) defined, ESI (extended implicid destination) defined, ECX (implicid count register)
                    Allows copying an arbitry length string from ESI memory pointer to EDI memory pointer of ECX string length
        configAddAlias() should be split into addParserAlias and addEngineAlias
            addParserAlias is just like it is now, the parser searches for and replaces a token with another token (or series of tokens)
            addEngineAlias would have to be run in the execution engine, dynamically changing register names as they are being executed
                would also have to add names for each register as part of self.config (IE: each register/memory element would get a dictionary of properties)
        ? should self.config store a config dictionary for EVERY key, index pair?
            Would use a tremendous amount of memory
            Would also make accessing data on a particular register/memory element more consistent
        Execution engine should not rely on Node labels to be labeled 'container' to recurse (it doesn't rely on it, but it also shouldn't be a case if it's handled by else?)

        Devices, SysCalls, Inturupts, and Input/Output:
            Should syscalls and devices be in their own interchangable modules? Yes
            Should syscalls and devices be together? Maybe?
            What are SysCalls?
                Part of the instruction set, referenced (but not defined) in class InstructionSetDefault.__init__(), IE: 'halt'
                Can redirect the instruction pointer to an OS function, where it executes instructions then returns
                Can be a system inturupt, which then redirects the instruction pointer to an OS function
                Can it be blocking (of CPUSim)? Yes
                    EX: input from keyboard
                Can it take in data from a predefined initialied array? No
                    EX: simulate keyboard input by reading from a file
                    Should be done via a device, where it can be better controled.
                It is a context switch to the OS
                    (Will need to read up on the priviliged RISCV instruction set)
            What is a Device?
                Some hardware thing that interfaces with the CPU but is not part of the CPU
                    IE: The Device is simulated AFTER the execution of an instruction (both inside the main execution loop)
                Can it be blocking (of CPUSim)? Yes
                    EX: input from keyboard
                Can it take in data from a predefined initialized array? Yes
                    EX: simulate keyboard input by reading from a file
                    The Device can be initialized at module Instantiation
                Can devices generate inturupts? Yes
                Should devices have full access to memory? Yes
                    A video display might use a memory range as a video buffer. And the 'user program' reads and writes to that memory range to manipualte video
                    EX: the way the Commador64/CommanderX16 handles video
            What is an Inturupt?
                Something that 'inturupts' the 'user program' to handle some event, then returns to the 'user program'
                Can the CPU send an 'inturupt' to a device? Maybe?
                    It would simplify activating and deactivating stuff like a keyboard input. Then the device would write back data via memory?
                Inturupts should be stored in the State['Engine'], for modular access by instructions

            IE: an instruction uses a variable amount of energy dependent on the data processed. It can report the energy used during its execution
        Support for self-modifying code
        Custom register/memory objects (instead of simple arrays) for tracking access (reads/writes) + transational history + additional stats and stat tracking
            memory controler/address translation
            will need a simple address pointer lookup function to simulate a redirect at the instruction composting stage
                IE: add(m[r[0]], r[1], r[4]) needs to be allowed
            can merge self.lastState and self.state into single state?
                No, will make it harder to understand instruction source code/cause confusion
            Case 1: Track register reads/writes
            Case 2: Keep track of data in a cache hierarchy
            Case 3: Allow multiple reads/writes per line/instruction word in the case of sloppy written source code, or Very Long Instruction Words which have multiple paralell instructions
            Case 4: Speculative execution will require keeping track of all reads/writes on a instruction word by instruction word basis, and allow for discarding some speculative results/operations
            Case 5: Since instructions are customizable, it is impossible to predict the dynamics of an instruction before executing it.
                Therefore implimenting superscaler stuff would require actually executing MANY following instructions and seeing which instructions conflict before deciding which instructions to schedual
                (yes, it's as backwords as it sounds, in possibly the most glorious and ironic way possible)
            Case 6: Out of Order execution would require keeping track of which instructions changed what, and when to commit the changes
        Microcode. The execution engine just isn't built out enough yet to consider this yet
            Microcode could run as a recursive CPU call, elimating the need for complex tracking of register windows, since it's run in a 'custom cpu construct' made for that instruction
            Microcode could be implimented at the instruction set composition level instead
                IE: add(a,b,c) used to make a vector add instruction (lambda a,b,c : add(a,b,c), add(a+1,b+1,c+1), add(a+2,b+2,c+2), etc)
                Only useful for simple instructions
        Instruction non-execution analysis utilities to better help calabrate instructions (IE: some utilities to help the user see energy use for each instruction in a graph before code is run)
        Support for virtual memory?
        should CPUsim have 'checkpoints' that can be reverted to?
